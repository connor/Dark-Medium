## Dark Medium

In my opinion, Medium is one of the most beautiful and
well-engineered web applications in the world. I don't write often, but
when I do, I wish there was a darker color scheme, which I think is
easier on my eyes (similar to how I use a dark color scheme for my text
editor). This does that.
