## Dark Medium

In my opinion, Medium is one of the most beautiful and
well-engineered web applications in the world. I don't write often, but
when I do, I wish there was a darker color scheme, which I think is
easier on my eyes (similar to how I use a dark color scheme for my text
editor). This does that.

## FYI...

I wrote this in about 10 minutes, and the code quality shows. It's very
much binded to the DOM and Medium's markup, and which may change at any
time. Use at your own risk.
